# QMKPhantomKB

A keystroke injector running on QMK Firmware.

## Project Timeline

| Week | Task | Status |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 2 |	Work with QMK documentation to become familiar with how it works | Complete |
| 3 |	Implement a simple keystroke injector capable of singular keyboard strokes with Arduino | Complete |
| 4 |	Implement a simple keystroke injector capable of singular keyboard strokes with QMK | Complete |
| 5 |	Add functionality to allow for terminal commands and scripts to be run | **WIP** |
| 6-8 |	Modify the user's configuration file to simulate keystroke injection functionality for extension goals | **WIP** |
| 9 |	Prepare for presentation and demonstration |
