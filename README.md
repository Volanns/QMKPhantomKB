# QMKPhantomKB

A keystroke injector running on QMK Firmware.

## Project Timeline

| Week | Task | Status |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 2 |	Work with QMK documentation to become familiar with how it works | Complete |
| 3 |	Implement a simple keystroke injector capable of singular keyboard strokes with Arduino | Complete |
| 4 |	Implement a simple keystroke injector capable of singular keyboard strokes with QMK | Complete |
| 5 |	Set up macros to inject commands on a Windows operating system | Complete |
| 7 |	Implement functionality to disable basic Windows security measures and establish a reverse shell on the target system | Complete |
| 8 | Remove traces of the exploit from the target system after establishing a remote connection | Complete |
| 9 |	Prepare for presentation and live demonstration | WIP |
